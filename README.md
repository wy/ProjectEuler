## Project Euler (Python Solutions)

These are my solutions to [Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net), written for Python 3.5+.
The main aim was for the solution to be a) correct, b) easy to understand.
As a result, these solutions won't necessarily be the most concise or elegant.

Where possible, I've added commentary to explain interesting ideas or asides.

The best way to learn is to try solving the problems yourselves.

### Primes

Prime number testing comes up a lot for Project Euler, given how central primes are to Number Theory.

I have implemented a few different prime tests depending on how computationally intensive the problems are.

Where needed, I've used the 6n +/- 1 test to speed things up.
